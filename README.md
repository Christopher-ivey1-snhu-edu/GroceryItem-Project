# GroceryItem-Project

-----Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

// This project was solving the problem of counting the number of items 
in a grocery list 


-----What did you do particularly well?

Setting up the integratation of C++ and Python together was definitely a
strong point in developing this code that I feel I did particularly well 
on. In addition to that, utilizing if else staetments and nested loops, I was able to deliver the frequency of the number of times the 
item appeared on the list.

---Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I would have like to enhance my code by making a way for it to allow a user to order groceries.
Then the system will store how many items the user chooses. 
Then also I could add a price to eaach item and then at the end displaythe total amount of purchased groceries 
for the user.
Then I would I would like to display a receipt and possibly a delivery date if they ordered online.
If they ordered online I could also ask the user to input address information.
I would also encrypt the code, in a way that it protects the user information, making the code more secure.



---Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?


The pieces of code that I found most challenging to write was the Python code that woulda call back too C++ to get the frequency. Also I forgot to upload the actual text input file that I would use to scan the items on. I had all of the correct code but the code had nothing to scan.  


------What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Understanding that there are many ways to build one code.
Learn what is easier for each project and build on top of that.
Also stay calm and use the tools and resources available to me.



------How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adding in-line comments,
within my code to give hints to the code that is easy to read.
